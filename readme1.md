# Mood-Based Music Recommendation System
This project aims to build a mood-based music recommendation system using sentiment analysis and machine learning techniques. By analyzing the sentiment of song lyrics and user mood annotations, the system recommends music tracks that match the user's current mood, enhancing their music listening experience.
## Data Collection
Gather a dataset of music tracks along with their associated metadata, such as artist, genre, and lyrics.
Collect a dataset of user mood annotations for these tracks. This dataset could be obtained through surveys, user feedback, or by analyzing social media posts related to music listening experiences.
## Preprocessing
Clean and preprocess the music metadata, which may involve tasks like handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing numerical features.
For sentiment analysis, preprocess the song lyrics by removing stopwords, punctuation, and performing lemmatization or stemming.
## Sentiment Analysis
Use natural language processing (NLP) techniques to analyze the sentiment of song lyrics.
Employ sentiment analysis libraries like NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) or spaCy to classify the mood of each song as positive, negative, or neutral based on its lyrics.
Alternatively, use pre-trained sentiment analysis models like VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner) to automatically classify the sentiment of song lyrics.
## Feature Engineering
Extract features from the music metadata and sentiment analysis results that capture important characteristics related to user mood and music preferences.
Features could include genre, artist popularity, sentiment score of lyrics, tempo, and energy level of the music.
## Model Training
Choose a machine learning model (e.g., decision trees, random forests, or neural networks) to train the recommendation system.
Use the extracted features as input to the model and train it to predict the likelihood that a user will enjoy a particular song based on their mood.
## Evaluation
Evaluate the performance of the recommendation system using appropriate metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, or F1-score.
Conduct user studies or surveys to gather feedback on the recommendations and iterate on the system accordingly.
## Deployment
Deploy the trained recommendation system as a web application or mobile app where users can input their mood and receive personalized music recommendations.
Ensure that the system is scalable and can handle a large number of users and requests simultaneously.
## Feedback Loop
Incorporate user feedback and interactions with the recommendation system to continuously improve its performance and relevance.
Monitor user engagement metrics and update the recommendation model periodically to adapt to changing user preferences and trends.
