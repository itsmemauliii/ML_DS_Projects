# Interactive Recommendation System

Welcome to the Interactive Recommendation System repository! This project aims to develop a recommendation system that actively involves users in the recommendation process, allowing them to provide feedback, preferences, and constraints to refine their recommendations.

## Features and Components

### 1. Implicit and Explicit Feedback Mechanisms:
- **Implicit Feedback:** Captures user interactions and behaviors without explicit input.
- **Explicit Feedback:** Allows users to directly provide feedback on items they like or dislike.

### 2. User-Driven Exploration:
- Enables users to explore items based on their interests and preferences.
- Provides browsing options, search functionalities, and personalized discovery features.

### 3. Preference Elicitation:
- Actively elicits preferences from users to better understand their tastes.
- Utilizes preference surveys, lists, or sliders to gather user preferences across different dimensions.

### 4. Constraint Specification:
- Users can specify constraints or requirements to tailor recommendations.
- Allows setting filters based on price range, availability, content type, or specific item attributes.

### 5. Real-Time Feedback and Adaptation:
- Dynamically adjusts recommendations based on real-time user feedback and interactions.
- Reflects evolving user preferences by continuously adapting recommendations.

### 6. User Engagement Strategies:
- Incorporates gamification elements, rewards, and notifications to encourage user engagement.
- Motivates users to provide feedback and explore recommendations.

### 7. Explanations and Transparency:
- Provides explanations for recommended items to enhance transparency and user understanding.
- Includes information about why items are recommended and how they align with user preferences.
